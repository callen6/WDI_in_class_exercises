Well, it wasn't completely empty; there was a #{container} of #{dinner_food} growing mold in the back corner. Since the #{container} of #{dinner_food} was most certainly not Liz'a favorite, ham, she grabbed her #{pet} named #{pet_name} and headed for the corner deli, #{restaurant}. It may not look like much on the outside, but #{restaurant} is the #{adjective}est ham joint in New York City. The line was moving #{adverb}, so Liz decided to use #{pet_name} to cut to the front. Being a very #{adjective} #{pet}, #{pet_name} scared the pants off of everyone else in line, and Liz waltzed up to #{restaurant}'s front counter, grabbed her ham in one had, her #{pet_name} in the other, and headed home. Lemon out!"
